3. Briefly explain how design principles such as proximity, contrast, typography, etc. are considered in your
website’s design.
In enhancing my website's design, I've prioritized key principles. Proximity has been improved to prevent overcrowding, with increased spacing between clickable elements. Adhering to WCAG contrast standards, I utilized the WebAIM Contrast Checker for optimal text visibility. Typography choices, such as the use of the Roboto font, focus on readability and a modern aesthetic. These refinements aim to create a visually appealing and accessible user experience.

In aligning with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, I implemented diverse strategies. This includes prioritizing contrast for better visibility, providing text alternatives for images to enhance content comprehension, utilizing descriptive labels for improved navigation, and ensuring proper HTML semantics for a more accessible website structure. These efforts collectively contribute to a website that is inclusive and accommodating to a diverse range of users.

5. Briefly explain what search engine optimization strategy or strategies were used in your website.
To optimize my website for search engines, I implemented a comprehensive strategy with a focus on keyword optimization using WordTracker. This tool was instrumental in identifying relevant keywords and phrases that align with my content and target audience. By strategically incorporating these keywords into my website's meta tags, headers, and content, I aimed to enhance its visibility in search engine results. Additionally, I prioritized creating high-quality, relevant content, improving website speed, and ensuring mobile responsiveness, all contributing to a holistic approach to search engine optimization (SEO).
